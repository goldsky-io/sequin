title: Sequin Cloud shutdown
description: Important information about the Sequin Cloud shutdown and migration to self-hosting.
---

**Sequin has been acquired and Sequin Cloud will be shutting down on October 23, 2025**.

We know this creates disruption, and we want to make the transition as smooth as possible. Since Sequin is fully open-source under the MIT license, we're committed to helping you migrate to a self-hosted deployment.

In the near term, the core Sequin team's input to the open-source project will scale down to maintenance mode. We'll continue prioritizing security patches and critical bug fixes, though new feature development will slow significantly. Looking ahead, we're excited about the potential for renewed investment in the project inside the acquiring company, though the timeline isn't set and may extend into 2026.

## What's happening

- All Cloud subscriptions have been canceled.
- **Over the next 60 days**: Sequin Cloud services will continue to run as you migrate to self-hosting or another solution.
- **October 23, 2025**: Sequin Cloud will be turned off, pipelines will stop, and all hosted data will be permanently and securely deleted.

## Migration options

### Self-hosting Sequin (Recommended)

Since Sequin is open-source, you can run it on your own infrastructure with full feature parity to the cloud version. We have comprehensive guides to help you get started:

- ðŸ†• **[Terraform to deploy on AWS ECS](https://github.com/sequinstream/sequin/tree/main/deployment)**
- **[Deploy to Production](/how-to/deploy-to-production)**
- **[Helm Chart](https://github.com/sequinstream/helm-chart-sequin)**
- **[Deploy Sequin on Railway](https://railway.com/deploy/TXSiv2)**
- **[sequin.yaml](/reference/sequin-yaml)** - Configuration file reference for exporting and importing data

### Migration support

We're committed to making this transition smooth:
